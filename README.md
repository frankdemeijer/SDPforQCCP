# SDPforQCCP
This repository contains all public files corresponding to the project "SDP-based bounds for the Quadratic Cycle Cover Problem via cutting plane augmented Lagrangian methods and reinforcement learning" by F. de Meijer and R. Sotirov. 

For each instance type the user can download a ZIP-file containing all instances of that type in txt-format. We have in total three instances types: Erdös-Rényi instances (uniform and reload), Manhattan instances and reload instances. Information on how to interpret these txt-files can be found in the document 'readInstances.txt'.
